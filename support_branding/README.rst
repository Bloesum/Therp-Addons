Support branding
================

If you run an Odoo support company and you support customers without an OPW,
you can brand the Odoo instance accordingly using this module. This module will
add a line `Supported by $yourcompany` in the menu footer and add a button to
mail exception messages to your support email address.

support_branding.company_name

    Your company's website

support_branding.company_color
